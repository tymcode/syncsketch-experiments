Miscellaneous experiments with the SyncSketch APIs

## `ssdump`
Catalogues Projects, Reviews, Items and Comments from a Syncketch Account. This is mostly for me to familiarize myself with using the Python API for SyncSketch.

Search keywords allowing it to focus on individual Projects, Reviews and Items are in the `config.yaml` file. You must export your SyncSketch.com credentials as `ss_username` and `ss_api_key`.
